As the title indicates, I have recently needed to set up SharePoint 2010 in Azure. As any good consultant would, I need to provide due diligence to the recommendations and solutions I suggest for my customers. Unfortunately for me, one of these customers is running SharePoint 2010. So I needed to build myself a development environment.
