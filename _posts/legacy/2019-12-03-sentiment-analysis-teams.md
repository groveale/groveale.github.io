If you had read my last post you will have seen the ropey solution I knocked up during a hackathon at a Microsoft event I attended.

I liked the solution, using cognitive services to perform sentiment analysis was simple but impressive. I also enjoyed dabbling with the Microsoft Graph endpoints. But I felt it wasn't very teams orientated - I needed a newidea.
