# The Morning That Changed My Mind About AI-Assisted Development

It's 7:00 AM on a Monday morning, and I'm staring at my coffee cup, contemplating the day ahead. I had promised to showcase my SPFx-archive solution this morning, so I crack open the repository with the confidence of someone who definitely remembers what they built two years ago.

*Spoiler alert: I was in for a surprise.*

## The Reality Check

Opening up the solution, I'm greeted by that familiar sight that makes every developer's heart sink slightly:

**`.NET 6`**

Great. This hasn't been updated for almost two years. But here's the kicker – I head over to Azure to deploy an Azure Function, only to discover that the minimum requirement is now **.NET 8**.

*Queue the internal groan.*

But you know what? Let's embrace the chaos. I kick off a new Azure Function deployment at exactly **7:09 AM** and decide to document this journey.

## Enter GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

Back in the repository, instead of diving into the documentation rabbit hole or spending precious morning hours researching migration paths, I decide to try something different. A simple, conversational prompt:

```
I need to update my solution to .NET 8. How should I do this?
```

And just like that, GitHub Copilot Agent Mode springs into action like a digital project manager who actually knows what they're doing.

### The Magic Unfolds

Copilot immediately gets to work:

1. **First stop**: Updating the target framework in my `.csproj` files
2. **Next**: Systematically checking for other configuration files that need attention  
3. **Then**: Identifying that my NuGet packages need updating to .NET 8 compatible versions
4. **Finally**: Running clean and restore operations

*"If only it was this easy,"* I think to myself, sipping my coffee with cautious optimism.

## When Reality Hits Back

But of course, software development is never that straightforward. Build errors start cascading across my screen like a digital avalanche. Syntax errors everywhere. My solution is suddenly speaking a language I don't recognize.

Then it hits me: **Graph SDK 4.x to 5.x migration**.

The NuGet updates had silently upgraded my Graph modules from version 4.x to 5.x, bringing with it a whole new world of breaking changes. Copilot, bless its algorithmic heart, starts getting a bit flustered trying to force-install NuGet modules that are now incompatible.

## Course Correction: The Art of AI Direction

Time to step in as the human in the loop. I stop Copilot's automated flailing and provide some strategic direction:

```
The errors in this class are related to the move from Graph SDK 4.x to 5.x. 
The main changes are: 
* Removed the .Request() method call
* Direct method calls on the resource endpoints
* Simplified syntax overall

Can you fix these up?
```

## The AI Gets Its Groove Back

With this context, Copilot transforms from a confused intern to a seasoned developer. It methodically works through my codebase:

- Fixing method calls across multiple classes
- Updating syntax to match the new SDK patterns
- Periodically rebuilding the solution to validate changes
- Making incremental progress with each iteration

While Copilot works its magic, I realize this experience is worth sharing. So I open up my blog editor and start documenting this journey in real-time, taking screenshots and notes as the transformation unfolds.

## The Results: Numbers Don't Lie

By **7:24 AM** – just 15 minutes after starting – all code updates were complete.

### The Final Tally:
- **~30 individual changes** across the solution
- **~75 lines of code** modified
- **Multiple methods** touching Graph SDK interactions
- **Zero manual research** required
- **One very impressed developer**

## The Reality of What Just Happened

Let me be brutally honest: this update would have consumed my entire morning, possibly my entire day. In the pre-AI world, I would have:

1. Spent 2+ hours reading migration documentation
2. Manually updated each file, one syntax error at a time
3. Probably given up halfway through and rebuilt the solution from scratch
4. Definitely not had time to write a blog post about it

Instead, I've:
- ✅ Modernized a legacy solution
- ✅ Fixed dozens of breaking changes
- ✅ Written a blog post documenting the experience
- ✅ Still have time for breakfast

And it's not even 8:00 AM yet.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about saving time (though that 15-minute migration is pretty incredible). It's about fundamentally changing how we approach technical debt and modernization efforts.

GitHub Copilot Agent Mode didn't just help me update code – it became a collaborative partner that:
- **Understood context** when I provided strategic direction
- **Learned from failures** and adjusted its approach
- **Maintained focus** on the end goal while handling the tedious details
- **Enabled me to stay creative** while it handled the mechanical work

## Now for Some Breakfast

As I close my laptop and head to the kitchen, I can't help but smile. The future of development isn't about AI replacing developers – it's about AI amplifying what we can accomplish when we work together.

*And honestly? That's pretty exciting.*
